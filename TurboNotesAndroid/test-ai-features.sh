echo

echo "4. üì∏ PHOTO TEXT EXTRACTION:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Tap menu ‚Üí 'üì∏ Take Photo & Extract Text'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Take photo of text (document, sign, etc.)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ AI will extract and describe image content"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Creates new note with extracted text + image reference"
echo

echo "5. üñºÔ∏è IMAGE IMPORT & PROCESSING:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Tap menu ‚Üí 'üñºÔ∏è Select Image & Extract Text'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Choose image from gallery"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ AI processes and extracts text information"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Creates note with image analysis"
echo

echo "6. üè∑Ô∏è AUTO-CATEGORIZATION:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Create several notes with different topics"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Tap menu ‚Üí 'üè∑Ô∏è Auto-Categorize All Notes'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ AI will analyze and categorize all notes"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Notes get assigned categories automatically"
echo

echo "üìä TESTING SCENARIOS:"
echo "===================="
echo

echo "SCENARIO 1: Meeting Notes Summary"
echo "‚Ä¢ Create note: 'Team meeting discussed Q4 goals, budget allocation for new projects, hiring plans for engineering team, and upcoming client presentations. John will handle budget, Sarah manages hiring, Mike prepares presentations.'"
echo "‚Ä¢ Use AI summarization ‚Üí Should create concise summary"
echo

echo "SCENARIO 2: Note Enhancement"
echo "‚Ä¢ Create simple note: 'Buy groceries'"
echo "‚Ä¢ Use AI enhancement ‚Üí Should expand with suggestions"
echo

echo "SCENARIO 3: Photo Processing"
echo "‚Ä¢ Take photo of printed text or handwritten note"
echo "‚Ä¢ AI should describe/extract visible content"
echo "‚Ä¢ Note: Current model provides image description, not OCR"
echo

echo "SCENARIO 4: Categorization Test"
echo "‚Ä¢ Create notes about work, personal, shopping, travel"
echo "‚Ä¢ Run auto-categorization ‚Üí Should assign relevant categories"
echo

echo "üîß TECHNICAL TESTING:"
echo "===================="
echo

echo "# Check AI model loading:"
echo "adb logcat -s Capacitor | grep -i \"AI\\|model\\|transform\""
echo

echo "# Monitor memory usage during AI operations:"
echo "adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.turbonotes.app"
echo

echo "# Check for Web Worker errors:"
echo "adb logcat -s chromium | grep -i \"worker\\|error\""
echo

echo "# Take screenshot during AI processing:"
echo "adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/ai_processing.png"
echo "adb pull /sdcard/ai_processing.png ."
echo

echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  KNOWN LIMITATIONS:"
echo "====================="
echo "‚Ä¢ First model load takes 30-60 seconds (downloading)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Models are quantized for mobile performance"
echo "‚Ä¢ Image 'text extraction' currently provides descriptions"
echo "‚Ä¢ Processing happens locally (privacy-first)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Requires ~100MB storage for models"
echo

echo "üéØ PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS:"
echo "============================"
echo "‚Ä¢ Model Loading: 30-60 seconds first time"
echo "‚Ä¢ Text Summarization: 5-15 seconds"
echo "‚Ä¢ Note Enhancement: 10-20 seconds"
echo "‚Ä¢ Image Processing: 5-10 seconds"
echo "‚Ä¢ Categorization: 2-5 seconds per note"
echo

echo "üîç TROUBLESHOOTING:"
echo "=================="
echo "‚Ä¢ If AI features don't work: Check console for errors"
echo "‚Ä¢ If models won't load: Clear app data and restart"
echo "‚Ä¢ If camera doesn't work: Check permissions"
echo "‚Ä¢ If processing is slow: Normal for first-time inference"
echo
